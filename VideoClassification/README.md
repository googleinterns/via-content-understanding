# Segment Level Classification

An implementation of the [cross class relevance learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.08548) model. In this implementation, I implement a state of the art [video classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.06905) model.



The files mean_average_precision_calculator.py, eval_util.py, and average_precision_calculator.py originate from the starter code for the [Youtube-8M competition](https://github.com/google/youtube-8m/). They are used to evaluate the model during and post training.
