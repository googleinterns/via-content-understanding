# Segment Level Classification

An implementation of the [cross class relevance learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.08548) model. In this implementation, I implement a state of the art [video classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.06905) model.

Some files, including readers.py are modified code from the starter code for the [Youtube-8M competition](https://github.com/google/youtube-8m/).
